### This library is NOT compatible with TurtleCoin pre-2.0.0

It is a brand new, from scratch implementation of the concepts implemented within. It contains library specific hash domains, challenge constructions, seeds, and other changes that make it practically 100% incompatible with any other library or implementation. Wallets generated with this wrapper are deterministically generated in an entirely different way and are not compatible with legacy implementations.

Do not open issues when this library does not work with TurtleCoin pre-2.0.0 or any other CryptoNote based project -- they will be closed. Legacy support and alternate implementations are not within the scope of this project.

## Javascript Library

**Note:** We build prebuilds of the Node.js native addon module as well as the WASM/JS binaries that are included for distribution with the NPM installed version of this package to speed up your development efforts.

If the prebuild for your system does not exist, it will compile the Node.js native addon module using CMake automatically.

### Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= +12.x LTS (or Node v12)
* Compiler supporting C++17 (gcc/clang/etc)

### Node.js / Typescript / Javascript Installation

#### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @turtlecoin/crypto
```

#### NPM
```bash
npm install @turtlecoin/crypto
```

### Intialization

#### TypeScript

```javascript
import Crypto from '@turtlecoin/crypto';

(async() => {
    const crypto = new Crypto();
    
    await crypto.initialize();
})
```

#### CommonJS

```javascript
const Crypto = require('turtlecoin-crypto').default

(async() => {
    const crypto = new Crypto();
    
    await crypto.initialize();
})
```

#### Documentation

You can find the full TypeScript/JS documentation for this library [here](https://crypto.turtlecoin.dev).

## C++ Library

A CMakeLists.txt file enables easy builds on most systems. 

The CMake build system builds an optimized static library for you. 

However, it is best to simply include this project in your project as a dependency with your CMake project.

Please reference your system documentation on how to compile with CMake.

To use this library in your project(s) simply link against the build target (`crypto-static`) and include the following in your relevant source or header file(s).

```c++
#include <crypto.h>
```

### Documentation

C++ API documentation can be found in the headers (.h)

## Cloning this Repository

This repository uses submodules, make sure you pull those before doing anything if you are cloning this project.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-crypto
cd turtlecoin-crypto
```

### As a dependency
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-crypto external/turtlecoin-crypto
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
